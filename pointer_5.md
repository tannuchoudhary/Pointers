# Allocating memory
* Allocating memory is nowadays a serious problem, as we have to allocate a memory which is not allocated for anyone else.
* And Sometimes you just need a little ammount of memory and you end up allocating a large amount of memory, for us it is so normal to 
  waste memory as we do have a lot of memory but while working with hardware devices orservers even a small ammount of memory matters a lot.

 when you are dealing with large ammount of memory or very small ammount of memory, it is very useful that you utilize your memory very well.

Memory allocation can be done by malloc() function.
