# pointers
## The relationship between pointer and array(or strings).
* Arrays in c are the sequence of data stored somewhere in memory.
* And strings are just an array of characters.
* The address of the first element of an array is the address of the array.
* The name you give to the array variable is also the address of the array.
>In simple words array is the same as an address in memory that defines the beginning of sequential  
data itemms and dealing with an  array is  same as dealing with an addresses.
