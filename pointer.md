# Pointers
## This section contains notes on pointers.
### Pointer basics
>We don't have to study pointers in most of the languages like Ruby, python, c# etc, as these languages use pointers but they hide it from users because of several reasons, but there is no way of escaping from pointers in c. so we will study some concepts of pointers.
>so let's get to the point
